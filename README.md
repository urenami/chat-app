# Chat App

This repository contains the code for a simple chat app built using React Native and React Navigation. The app allows users to enter their username, choose a background color, and start chatting.

## Screens

The app consists of two screens:

1. **Start**: This screen is the entry point of the app. Users can enter their username and choose a background color. The available background color options are dark, light grey, dark purple, and olive. Once the user selects a username and a background color, they can navigate to the chat screen.

2. **Chat**: This screen displays the chat interface. The background color of the screen is set based on the user's selection in the Start screen. The screen also shows the username at the top. Users can start chatting on this screen.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can interact with the user interface to enter your username, choose a background color, and start chatting. The chosen background color will be applied to the chat screen, and you can send and receive messages in the chat interface.
